      <h3>About Maleficent</h3>
      <p>Maleficent is a fantasy adventure movie that re-imagines the fairy tale of Sleeping Beauty and tells the story of bad fairy Maleficent (Angelina Jolie). At the beginning of the story, she is a young fairy who believes in love, peace and compassion. Living in the Moors, a magical realm with a neighbouring human kingdom, Maleficent meets and falls in love with a young man named Stefan (Sharlto Copley). Over the years, his human desire for power and greed take hold and the two lose contact.<br><br>

        The magic and human realms are soon at war, with the human king wanting to rid his world of the fantastical creatures that hold more power and strength than he and his army do. Stefan is promised that he will become king. He lures Maleficent into a trap, drugs her and cuts off her wings. She can no longer fly but is still magically very powerful.<br><br>
        
        Maleficent is blind with rage. After enlisting the help of Diaval (Sam Riley), a crow she turns into a man, she takes over the magical realm with her dark and evil magic. When King Stefan has a child, Maleficent sees her opportunity to take revenge. She puts a curse on the child – although the princess shall grow in beauty and grace, before the sun sets on her 16th birthday she will prick her finger on a spinning wheel spindle and fall into a sleep from which she can only ever be awoken by true love’s kiss.<br><br>
        
        The king orders that his daughter Aurora be taken away and raised in the woods by three fairies. This is to keep her safe from any spinning wheels that might have escaped the purge he ordered for the kingdom. As Aurora grows up, Maleficent finds herself looking after the girl from a distance and protecting her so that she survives to her 16th birthday. In fact, she becomes very fond of the girl and seeks to undo her curse.<p>
